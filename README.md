### **Ticket Analysis & Insights**  

#### **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes customer support ticket data to uncover trends, improve workload distribution, and enhance operational efficiency. The dataset includes ticket details such as status, priority, assignee, organization, product category, and timestamps for creation and resolution.  

#### **Key Objectives**  
1. **Understand Ticket Trends** – Analyze ticket volume, resolution time, and priority distribution.  
2. **Optimize Workload Allocation** – Identify workload imbalances among support agents.  
3. **Improve Customer Support Efficiency** – Provide data-driven recommendations for better ticket handling.  

#### **Data Insights**  
📌 A significant portion of tickets come from a few organizations (~50% from top 3).  
📌 Most tickets are assigned to a small number of team members, creating workload imbalances.  
📌 The majority of tickets are categorized as "high priority," requiring further classification.  
📌 Resolution times vary significantly, highlighting the need for process optimization.  

#### **Recommendations**  
✅ **Redistribute Workload** – Ensure fair ticket allocation to prevent agent burnout.  
✅ **Specialized Support Teams** – Assign dedicated teams for high-ticket-volume clients.
